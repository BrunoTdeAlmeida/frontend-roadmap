# Box Model and Flexbox

## üìö Box Model

The CSS Box Model is a fundamental concept that describes how elements are rendered on a web page. Every element is considered a rectangular box with the following properties:

### Box Model Components

1. **Content**: The actual content of the element (text, images, etc.)
2. **Padding**: Space between the content and the border
3. **Border**: A line that surrounds the padding and content
4. **Margin**: Space between the border and other elements

```css
.box {
  width: 200px; /* Content width */
  height: 100px; /* Content height */
  padding: 20px; /* Space inside */
  border: 2px solid black; /* Border */
  margin: 30px; /* Space outside */
}
```

### Box Sizing

The `box-sizing` property controls how the total width and height of an element is calculated:

- `content-box` (default): Width/height only includes content
- `border-box`: Width/height includes content, padding, and border

```css
.box {
  box-sizing: border-box; /* Recommended for easier calculations */
}
```

## üê∏ Flexbox

Flexbox is a powerful layout model that makes it easy to create flexible and responsive layouts. It's perfect for:

- Centering elements
- Creating equal-height columns
- Building navigation menus
- Creating responsive layouts

### Flex Container Properties

```css
.container {
  display: flex; /* Activates flexbox */
  flex-direction: row; /* Main axis direction */
  justify-content: center; /* Alignment on main axis */
  align-items: center; /* Alignment on cross axis */
  flex-wrap: wrap; /* Wrapping behavior */
  gap: 10px; /* Space between items */
}
```

### Flex Item Properties

```css
.item {
  flex-grow: 1; /* Ability to grow */
  flex-shrink: 1; /* Ability to shrink */
  flex-basis: 200px; /* Initial size */
  align-self: center; /* Individual alignment */
}
```
